## Info:
Sonic Shapes is a web application that allows the user to generate random visuals and sounds. The sounds are Web Audio synths created using the Tone.js library. The visuals are a series of shapes created using the p5.js library. When the user presses the ‘Generate’ button each synth is paired with a random shapeand the sound and visuals start to play. A shape appears when a note is played by the synth and disappears when the note of the synth turns off. The effect is an audio-visual experience with sound and visuals appearing seamlessly together. The audio is also semi-randomly generated as there are markov chains incorporated into some of the synths that determine which sequence of notes to play. The sequence of notes for certain synths is also shuffled so no loop of notes repeats itself.
